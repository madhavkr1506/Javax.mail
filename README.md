Java project leveraging the JavaMail library to send emails and SMS-like messages using the SMTP protocol

id1001: The code uses the JavaMail library to configure SMTP settings and send messages via email to specified recipients. This code sends an email with both text content and an attachment using JavaMail API via Gmail's SMTP server. We integrated HTML inline content and a file attachment into a single email by using a Multipart object, combining an HTML-formatted message for the email body and a dynamically created file as an attachment.we learned how to set a custom Reply-to address in emails using the JavaMail API to redirect replies to a specific email address different from the sender.
